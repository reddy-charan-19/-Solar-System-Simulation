# -Solar-System-Simulation
This Python-based project simulates the movement of planets around the Sun using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and math for orbital calculations. It provides an interactive, real-time visualization of the solar system, allowing users to explore planetary motions and view detailed planet information.
